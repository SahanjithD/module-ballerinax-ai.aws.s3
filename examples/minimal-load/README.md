# Minimal load

Loads documents from an S3 bucket and prints what came back — the smallest useful thing you can
do with the loader, and the quickest way to confirm your credentials, IAM policy, and target are
right before wiring up a full RAG pipeline.

A `Source` names a bucket and the `Target`s to read from it; this example configures a single
target covering one prefix.

For each document it prints the key, MIME type, size, ETag, and the first 200 characters of the
extracted text, so you can see that PDF/DOCX/PPTX extraction actually worked.

## Prerequisites

An S3 bucket with some documents in it, and credentials whose IAM policy allows `s3:ListBucket`
on the bucket and `s3:GetObject` on its objects. See the
[package README](../../ballerina/README.md#3-grant-the-required-iam-permissions) for a minimal
policy.

## Configuration

Create a `Config.toml` in this directory:

```toml
accessKeyId = "<ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
secretAccessKey = "<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
region = "us-east-1"
bucket = "my-corpus-bucket"

# Optional: restrict to a prefix. Defaults to "", the whole bucket.
prefix = "reports/"
```

> `Config.toml` holds live credentials — it is gitignored by this repository. Do not commit it.

`region` **must match the region the bucket was created in**. A mismatch fails with an opaque
`PermanentRedirect` / `AuthorizationHeaderMalformed` error rather than anything helpful; the
bucket's region is shown in the S3 console's Buckets list.

## Run the example

```bash
cd examples/minimal-load
bal run
```

## Expected output

```text

## Notes

- The configurable is called `prefix` because that is the common case, but the underlying
  `Target` field is `path` and also accepts an **exact object key** — `path: "reports/q1.pdf"`
  loads that one object.
- `recursive: true` descends into nested prefixes. Set it to `false` to load only the keys
  directly under `prefix`.
- The loader reads the **whole** matching corpus (paginating across listing pages), so a large
  bucket produces a large result — every document is held in memory until `load()` returns.
- To run this on EC2/ECS with an attached role instead of static keys, drop the `accessKeyId`
  and `secretAccessKey` configurables and pass `auth: s3:DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS` (the AWS default
  credential chain — environment, container, and instance-profile credentials).
