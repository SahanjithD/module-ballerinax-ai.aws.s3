# A rule selecting what to load from a bucket. S3 has no real folders, so `path` is
# interpreted against key prefixes (see the README's "How paths are resolved").
public type Target record {|
    # The object key or key prefix to load. A value ending in `/`, or the empty string
    # (the whole bucket), is treated as a prefix; any other value is tried first as an
    # exact key and, on a miss, as a prefix. Defaults to `""`, the whole bucket
    string path = "";
    # Whether a prefix is traversed into nested "sub-folders". When `false` (the
    # default) only keys directly under the prefix are loaded — keys whose remainder
    # after the prefix contains a further `/` are skipped
    boolean recursive = false;
    # Case-insensitive extension allowlist applied to keys found while walking a prefix
    # (a leading dot is optional, e.g. `pdf` and `.PDF` both match `report.pdf`).
    # An explicitly named exact key is always loaded regardless of this list.
    #
    # Filtering happens *after* listing, so this reduces how many documents are returned but
    # not how many keys are listed: a prefix holding 5000 images and 40 PDFs still exceeds the
    # one-page listing limit even when filtered to `["pdf"]`. Narrow `path` for that.
    # An empty array behaves like `()` — everything is allowed.
    # Defaults to `()`, meaning all supported types
