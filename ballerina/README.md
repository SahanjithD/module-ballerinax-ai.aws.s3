## Overview

This package provides an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) data loader for Ballerina AI
applications. It reads objects from S3 buckets and returns them as `ai:TextDocument` values,
ready to be chunked, embedded, and indexed for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

It implements the `ai:DataLoader` abstraction, so it can be used anywhere an `ai:DataLoader` is
expected and its output feeds directly into `ai:KnowledgeBase.ingest`. Natively-textual objects are
decoded directly; PDF, Word (`.docx`), PowerPoint (`.pptx`) and Excel (`.xlsx`) documents have their
text extracted **in memory** — object content is never written to disk.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Create an S3 bucket

Create a bucket and upload the documents you want to index, following the
[AWS S3 getting-started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html).

### 2. Obtain credentials

The loader authenticates in one of two ways:

- **Static credentials** — an access key pair for an IAM user or role, optionally with a session
  token for temporary (STS) credentials. See
  [Managing access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).
- **EC2/ECS IAM role** — no keys at all; credentials are resolved from the AWS infrastructure the
  code runs on. An ECS task role is resolved through the ECS container credential endpoint, while an
  EC2 instance profile is resolved through the EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). This works only
  when running on AWS infrastructure with an attached instance or task role.

### 3. Grant the required IAM permissions

The loader only ever reads. It needs exactly two actions:

| Action | Applied to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `s3:ListBucket` | the **bucket** ARN | to enumerate keys under a prefix |
| `s3:GetObject` | the **object** ARN (`/*`) | to download object content |

A minimal policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ListBucketContents",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-corpus-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ReadObjects",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-corpus-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

To restrict access to a single prefix, narrow the `GetObject` resource to
`arn:aws:s3:::my-corpus-bucket/reports/*` and add an `s3:prefix` condition to the `ListBucket`
statement.

## Quickstart

### Step 1: Import the module

```ballerina
import ballerinax/ai.aws.s3;
```

### Step 2: Create a loader

```ballerina
s3:TextDataLoader loader = check new (
    {
        auth: {
            accessKeyId: "<ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
            secretAccessKey: "<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
        },
        region: "us-east-1"
    },
    [
        {
            bucket: "my-corpus-bucket",
            targets: [{path: "reports/", recursive: true}]
        }
    ]
);
```

### Step 3: Load the documents

```ballerina
import ballerina/ai;

ai:Document[]|ai:Document documents = check loader.load();
```

`load()` returns a **bare `ai:Document`** when exactly one object is resolved and an
`ai:Document[]` otherwise — the same contract as `ai`'s built-in `TextDataLoader`. Both shapes are
accepted directly by `ingest`:

```ballerina
check knowledgeBase.ingest(documents);
```

## Configuration

### Connection

The loader's first argument is either an
[`s3:ConnectionConfig`](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/aws.s3/latest#ConnectionConfig)
— the `ballerinax/aws.s3` connector's own configuration, from which the loader builds a client —
or an already-configured `s3:Client` you want it to reuse.

`ConnectionConfig` has two fields: `auth` and `region`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth` | `StaticAuthConfig \| ProfileAuthConfig \| DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS` | — | How to authenticate (see below) |
| `region` | `Region` | `US_EAST_1` (`"us-east-1"`) | **Must match the region each bucket was created in** — a mismatch fails with an opaque `PermanentRedirect` error. The bucket's region is shown in the S3 console's Buckets list |

```ballerina
import ballerinax/aws.s3 as awsS3;

// Static credentials (an access key pair)
awsS3:ConnectionConfig config = {
    auth: {accessKeyId: "AKIA...", secretAccessKey: "..."},
    region: "us-east-1"
};

// Temporary (STS) credentials add a session token
awsS3:ConnectionConfig config = {
    auth: {accessKeyId: "ASIA...", secretAccessKey: "...", sessionToken: "..."},
    region: "us-east-1"
};

// AWS default credential chain — environment variables, ECS container credentials,
// and EC2/ECS instance-profile (IAM role) credentials, resolved automatically
awsS3:ConnectionConfig config = {auth: awsS3:DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS, region: "us-east-1"};

// A named profile from the shared AWS credentials file
awsS3:ConnectionConfig config = {auth: {profileName: "prod"}, region: "us-east-1"};
```

**Prefer `DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS` in production** when running on AWS: it resolves the instance or
task role automatically and needs no long-lived keys in configuration. The examples use static
credentials only because they must run anywhere.

#### Reusing an existing client

Passing a ready `s3:Client` lets you share one client across several loaders, or configure the
connector in ways the loader's config does not surface:

```ballerina
awsS3:Client s3Client = check new ({
    auth: {accessKeyId: "AKIA...", secretAccessKey: "..."},
    region: "us-east-1"
});

s3:TextDataLoader loader = check new (s3Client, [{bucket: "my-corpus-bucket"}]);
```

### Sources and targets

A `Source` names a bucket and the `Target`s to read from it. Several sources may be configured in
one loader; their documents are aggregated in the order given.

| `Target` field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | `string` | `""` | An object key or key prefix. See "How paths are resolved" below |
| `recursive` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to descend into nested prefixes |
| `includeExtensions` | `string[]?` | `()` (all types) | Case-insensitive extension allowlist; a leading dot is optional |

```ballerina
{
    bucket: "my-corpus-bucket",
    targets: [
        {path: "reports/2026/", recursive: true, includeExtensions: [".pdf", "docx"]},
        {path: "policies/handbook.md"}
    ]
}
```

### How paths are resolved

S3 has no folders — only keys that happen to contain `/`. So:

- `""` (the default) or a value ending in `/` is treated as a **prefix**.
- Anything else is tried as an **exact key** first and, if no such key exists, treated as a prefix.
- Keys ending in `/` (the zero-byte "folder" objects the S3 console creates) are always skipped.
- With `recursive: false`, only keys directly under the prefix are loaded — a key whose remainder
  after the prefix contains another `/` is skipped.

An unsupported file type named **explicitly** as an exact key is an error. An unsupported file
found while **walking a prefix** is skipped with a logged warning, so one stray image cannot fail
an entire corpus load.

> **Collision to be aware of:** if a bucket holds *both* an object at key `reports` and objects
> under `reports/`, then `path: "reports"` resolves the single object and ignores the folder
> entirely — the exact-key match wins and there is no error. Write `path: "reports/"` when you
> mean the prefix.

### Loader options (`LoaderOptions`)

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maxObjectSize` | `int` | `104857600` (100 MiB) | Largest single object read into memory; a bigger object fails with a clear error rather than risking an out-of-memory condition |

```ballerina
s3:TextDataLoader loader = check new (connectionConfig, sources,
        {maxObjectSize: 20 * 1024 * 1024});
```

Like the SharePoint data loader, there is **no document-count cap** — `load()` returns every
matching object. See Limitations for the memory implication.

## Supported file types

The supported set matches `ballerina/ai`'s built-in `TextDataLoader` exactly, plus the
natively-textual formats S3 buckets commonly hold.

| Type | Extensions | How the text is obtained |
|---|---|---|
| Markup | `md`, `markdown`, `html`, `htm` | Decoded verbatim (tags and all); stripping is the chunker's job |
| Plain text | `txt`, `text`, `csv`, `tsv`, `json`, `xml`, `yaml`, `yml`, `log`, `ini`, `conf`, `properties`, `css`, `js`, `ts` | Decoded directly as UTF-8 |
| PDF | `pdf` | Apache Tika `PDFParser` + PDFBox, in memory |
| Word | `docx` | Apache POI `XWPFWordExtractor`, in memory |
| PowerPoint | `pptx` | Apache POI `SlideShowExtractor`, in memory |
| Excel | `xlsx` | Apache POI `XSSFExcelExtractor`, in memory — tab-separated cells, one row per line, each sheet prefixed with its name |
| **Legacy binary Office** | `doc`, `ppt`, `xls` | **Not supported** — convert to the OOXML `.docx` / `.pptx` / `.xlsx` or PDF |
| Anything else | images, audio, unknown binary | Skipped (an error if named explicitly) |

Object metadata is attached to every document: `fileName` (the key), `mimeType`, `fileSize`,
`modifiedAt`, plus the open fields `bucket`, `key`, and `eTag`.

## Limitations

Please read these before indexing a large or busy bucket.

- **The whole matching corpus is read into memory.** There is no document-count cap (matching the
  SharePoint data loader); the loader paginates across every listing page and materializes every
  document, because `ai:DataLoader.load()` returns a `Document[]` — there is no streaming or cursor
  in the interface. A very large prefix therefore produces a correspondingly large in-memory
  result. Narrow the `path`, or split the work across several loads, if that is a concern.
- **A prefix walk is bounded at 10,000 listing pages.** That ceiling is a safety net, not a document
  cap: it guarantees the walk terminates whatever the listing returns, and reaching it is an error
  rather than a partial corpus. Ten thousand pages covers ten million listed entries — counting both
  objects and, for a non-recursive walk, the sub-folders S3 rolls into CommonPrefixes — so no
  listing this loader could return in memory comes close. A walk that hits it needs a narrower
  `path`.
- **Skipped objects are reported only to the log.** Archived, over-sized, undecodable and
  unsupported objects are skipped with a warning so that one bad object cannot fail a whole corpus,
  but `load()` returns a shorter array with no programmatic signal. A caller cannot distinguish
  "nothing matched" from "several objects were skipped" without reading the logs.
- **`load()` has no overall time limit.** The paging loop always terminates, but `ballerinax/aws.s3`
  5.0.0 exposes no timeout, retry or HTTP configuration on `ConnectionConfig`, so a stalled
  connection blocks the call indefinitely. Apply a deadline on the calling side if you need one.
- **S3 Express One Zone (directory) buckets are not usable.** Every object in one reports the
  `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` storage class, which is absent from the connector's `StorageClass` enum, so
  listing and metadata calls fail to deserialize. The exact-key path is designed to work on them —
  HEAD is order-independent, which unordered directory-bucket listings require — and needs no change
  here once the connector is fixed.
- **A listing is not a consistent snapshot.** S3 read and list operations are strongly consistent,
  but a paginated load is not an atomic snapshot: the loader pages through a listing, and concurrent
  writes across page requests can cause objects to be missed or double-counted — inherent to
  paginated listing.
- **Each object is read entirely into memory.** Extraction reads from an in-memory buffer so that
  no temporary file is ever written, but each object must therefore fit in the heap. `maxObjectSize`
  (default 100 MiB) bounds each individual object read; an object larger than that is a clear error
  rather than an attempted load.
- **Non-recursive filtering.** The loader lists with delimiter `/`, so S3 returns only same-level
  keys (descendants roll into `CommonPrefixes`, which the connector drops); a client-side filter
  stays as a backstop.
- **No `versionId` selection.** The loader always reads the current version of each object. The
  underlying connector *can* fetch a specific version, but the loader does not expose it, so a
  corpus cannot be pinned to specific object versions.
- **An exact key is resolved by listing its prefix**, not with a `HEAD`, to avoid a download just
  to test existence. Functionally transparent; noted for cost accounting on very large prefixes.
- **Legacy binary Office formats are unsupported.** `.doc`, `.ppt` and `.xls` are recognised only
  so they can be rejected with a format-specific message or skipped. Convert them to their OOXML
  successors (`.docx`/`.pptx`/`.xlsx`) or PDF. The OOXML `.xlsx` is extracted via POI's
  `XSSFExcelExtractor`: cells are rendered tab-separated, one row per line, each sheet prefixed with
  its name, and formula cells contribute their last cached result.
- **One unreadable object fails the whole load.** If an object is deleted between being listed
  and being downloaded, or its content cannot be decoded or parsed, the entire `load()` returns an
  error rather than skipping it. This is deliberate — a silently incomplete RAG index is worse
  than a failed one — but it means a corpus in flux may need a retry. (Objects of *unsupported
  types* are skipped, not failed; this applies to genuine read/parse failures.)
- **No requester-pays support.** The connector's configuration exposes no requester-pays option,
  so cross-account requester-pays buckets cannot be read.
- **AWS endpoints only.** The connector's `ConnectionConfig` takes a `region` but no endpoint
  override, so S3-compatible services (MinIO, LocalStack, Cloudflare R2) cannot be targeted.
- **All buckets in one loader share one region**, since the region is set on the connection. A
  bucket in a different region fails with an opaque AWS redirect error; use one loader per region.

## Examples

The `ai.aws.s3` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios.

1. [Minimal load](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-ai.aws.s3/tree/main/examples/minimal-load)
   — load documents from a bucket and inspect what came back.
2. [RAG pipeline](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-ai.aws.s3/tree/main/examples/rag-pipeline)
   — load a corpus, ingest it into a knowledge base, and answer questions over it.
