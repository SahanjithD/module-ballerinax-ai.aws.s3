The `ballerinax/ai.aws.s3` package provides a `TextDataLoader` that reads objects from
[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) buckets and returns them as `ai:TextDocument` values, ready to
be chunked, embedded, and indexed by the [Ballerina AI](https://central.ballerina.io/ballerina/ai)
module.

It implements the `ai:DataLoader` abstraction, so it can be used anywhere an `ai:DataLoader` is
expected — for example, in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) ingestion pipeline.
Natively-textual objects are decoded directly, while PDF, Word (`.docx`), PowerPoint (`.pptx`) and
Excel (`.xlsx`) documents have their text extracted **in memory** with Apache Tika and Apache POI —
object content is never written to disk.

For the full API, configuration reference, supported file types, and usage guide, see the
[package documentation](ballerina/README.md).

## Limitations

Please read these before indexing a large or busy bucket.

- **The whole matching corpus is read into memory.** There is no document-count cap (matching the
  SharePoint data loader); the loader paginates across every listing page and materializes every
  document, because `ai:DataLoader.load()` returns a `Document[]` with no streaming. A very large
  prefix produces a correspondingly large in-memory result — narrow the `path` if that matters.
- **A listing is not a consistent snapshot.** S3 listings are eventually consistent and key-ordered;
  under concurrent writes, objects added or removed mid-load can be missed or double-counted.
- **Each object is read entirely into memory,** so that no temporary file is ever written.
  `maxObjectSize` (default 100 MiB) bounds this; a larger object is a clear error, not an OOM crash.
- **Non-recursive filtering happens client-side** — `recursive: false` still lists every key under
  the prefix and discards the nested ones, costing listing bandwidth on a wide prefix.
- **No `versionId` selection, no requester-pays, AWS endpoints only.** The loader reads current
  object versions; requester-pays buckets and S3-compatible endpoints (MinIO, LocalStack, R2) are
  not supported by the connector's configuration.
- **Legacy binary Office formats are unsupported** (`.doc`, `.ppt`, `.xls`). Convert them to their
  OOXML successors (`.docx`/`.pptx`/`.xlsx`) or PDF. The OOXML formats, including `.xlsx`, are
  extracted; a spreadsheet is rendered as tab-separated cells, one row per line, each sheet prefixed
  with its name.
- **All buckets in one loader share one region**, since `region` is set on the connection.
- **One unreadable object fails the whole load** — deliberately, since a silently incomplete RAG
  index is worse than a failed one. Objects of unsupported *types* are skipped, not failed.
- **No `versionId` and no requester-pays support**, as neither can be expressed through the
  connector.
- **AWS endpoints only** — S3-compatible services (MinIO, LocalStack, R2) cannot be targeted.

## Issues and projects

The **Issues** and **Projects** tabs are disabled for this repository as this is part of the
Ballerina library. To report bugs, request new features, start new discussions, view project boards,
etc., visit the Ballerina library [parent repository](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-library).

This repository only contains the source code for the package.

## Build from the source

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 21 (from one of the following locations).

   - [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
   - [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)

     > **Note:** Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path name of the directory into which you installed JDK.

2. Generate a GitHub access token with read package permissions, then set the following `env` variables:

   ```shell
   export packageUser=<Your GitHub Username>
   export packagePAT=<GitHub Personal Access Token>
   ```

   > **Note:** These credentials are required because the Ballerina Gradle plugin
   > (`io.ballerina.plugin`) is published to GitHub Packages, which requires authentication even
   > for public packages. Without them the Gradle build cannot resolve the plugin. See
   > [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for how to build and test using the `bal` CLI directly if
   > you do not have a token.

### Build options

Execute the commands below to build from the source.

1. To build the package:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

2. To run the tests:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean test
   ```

3. To run a group of tests

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean test -Pgroups=<test_group_names>
   ```

4. To build without the tests:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -x test
   ```

5. To debug the package with a remote debugger:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -Pdebug=<port>
   ```

6. To debug with Ballerina language:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -PbalJavaDebug=<port>
   ```

7. Publish the generated artifacts to the local Ballerina central repository:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -PpublishToLocalCentral=true
   ```

8. Publish the generated artifacts to the Ballerina central repository:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build -PpublishToCentral=true
   ```
